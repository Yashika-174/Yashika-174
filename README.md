# 👋 Hi, I'm Yashika Aggarwal

## 💫 About Me

I'm a passionate and results-driven web developer with a strong foundation in the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)**. I specialize in building seamless and scalable web applications that deliver great user experiences. My expertise includes developing interactive UIs with React, styling efficiently using Tailwind CSS, and managing application state with Redux.

Alongside my web development skills, I have solid experience in **C++, Python, and SQL**, which allows me to handle diverse technical tasks — from algorithmic problem-solving to backend database management. I'm always eager to explore new technologies and refine my skills by working on real-world projects.
